## DotaBot
Dota2 bot created out of interest
### Current state
This is currently a full rewrite of existing bots. Shadowfiend is a bad lasthitter currently experimenting with actual lasthitting. Goal is to learn about bot scripting and the API.<br />
### Tips
The `dota_bot_reload_scripts` command lets you reload your bot sourcecode ingame when entered into the game console.<br />
The command `host_timescale 4.0` lets you speed up time by factor 4 or more to save time.<br />
Experimentally you can also host a dedicated server on your machine with headless bots as described in this [thread](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=273803).
